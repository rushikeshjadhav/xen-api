# API Basics

This document defines the Citrix Hypervisor Management API - an interface for remotely
configuring and controlling virtualised guests running on a Xen-enabled host.

The API is presented here as a set of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). There are
two supported wire formats, one based upon [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html)
and one based upon [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org) (v1.0 and v2.0 are both
recognised). No specific language bindings are prescribed, although examples
will be given in the python programming language.

Although we adopt some terminology from object-oriented programming,
future client language bindings may or may not be object oriented.
The API reference uses the terminology _classes_ and _objects_.
For our purposes a _class_ is simply a hierarchical namespace;
an _object_ is an instance of a class with its fields set to
specific values. Objects are persistent and exist on the server-side.
Clients may obtain opaque references to these server-side objects and then
access their fields via get/set RPCs.

For each class we specify a list of fields along with their _types_ and
_qualifiers_. A qualifier is one of:

* `RO/runtime`: the field is Read Only. Furthermore, its value is
  automatically computed at runtime. For example, current CPU load and disk IO
  throughput.

* `RO/constructor`: the field must be manually set when a new object is
  created, but is then Read Only for the duration of the object's life.
  For example, the maximum memory addressable by a guest is set
  before the guest boots.

* `RW`: the field is Read/Write. For example, the name of a VM.

## Types

The following types are used to specify methods and fields in the API Reference:

* `string`: Text strings.
* `int`: 64-bit integers.
* `float`: IEEE double-precision floating-point numbers.
* `bool`: Boolean.
* `datetime`: Date and timestamp.
* `c ref`: Reference to an object of class `c`.
* `t set`: Arbitrary-length set of values of type `t`.
* `(k -> v) map`: Mapping from values of type `k` to values of type `v`.
* `e enum`: Enumeration type with name `e`. Enums are defined in the
  API reference together with classes that use them.

Note that there are a number of cases where `ref`s are _doubly linked_.
For example, a `VM` has a field called `VIFs` of type `VIF ref set`;
this field lists the network interfaces attached to a particular VM.
Similarly, the `VIF` class has a field called `VM` of type `VM ref`
which references the VM to which the interface is connected.
These two fields are _bound together_, in the sense that
creating a new VIF causes the `VIFs` field of the corresponding
VM object to be updated automatically.

The API reference lists explicitly the fields that are
bound together in this way. It also contains a diagram that shows
relationships between classes. In this diagram an edge signifies the
existence of a pair of fields that are bound together, using standard
crows-foot notation to signify the type of relationship (e.g.
one-many, many-many).

## RPCs associated with fields

Each field, `f`, has an RPC accessor associated with it that returns `f`'s value:

* `get_f (r)`: takes a `ref`, `r` that refers to an object and returns the value
  of `f`.

Each field, `f`, with qualifier `RW` and whose outermost type is `set` has the
following additional RPCs associated with it:

* `add_f(r, v)`: adds a new element `v` to the set.
  Note that sets cannot contain duplicate values, hence this operation has
  no action in the case that `v` is already in the set.

* `remove_f(r, v)`: removes element `v` from the set.

Each field, `f`, with qualifier `RW` and whose outermost type is `map` has the
following additional RPCs associated with it:

* `add_to_f(r, k, v)`: adds new pair `k -> v` to the mapping stored in `f` in
  object`r`. Attempting to add a new pair for duplicate key, `k`, fails with a
  `MAP_DUPLICATE_KEY` error.

* `remove_from_f(r, k)`: removes the pair with key `k`
  from the mapping stored in `f` in object `r`.

Each field whose outermost type is neither `set` nor `map`, but whose
qualifier is `RW` has an RPC accessor associated with it that sets its value:

* `set_f(r, v)`: sets the field `f` on object `r` to value `v`.

## RPCs associated with classes

* Most classes have a _constructor_ RPC named `create` that
  takes as parameters all fields marked `RW` and `RO/constructor`. The result
  of this RPC is that a new _persistent_ object is created on the server-side
  with the specified field values.

* Each class has a `get_by_uuid(uuid)` RPC that returns the object
  of that class that has the specified `uuid`.

* Each class that has a `name_label` field has a
  `get_by_name_label(name_label)` RPC that returns a set of objects of that
  class that have the specified `name_label`.

* Most classes have a `destroy(r)` RPC that explicitly deletes
  the persistent object specified by `r` from the system.  This is a
  non-cascading delete - if the object being removed is referenced by another
  object then the `destroy` call will fail.

Apart from the RPCs enumerated above, some classes have additional RPCs
associated with them. For example, the `VM` class has RPCs for cloning,
suspending, starting etc. Such additional RPCs are described explicitly
in the API reference.
